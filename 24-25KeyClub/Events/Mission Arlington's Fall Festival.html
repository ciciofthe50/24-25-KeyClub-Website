    <div class="positiontextcenterbody">At Mission Arlington's Fall Festival, volunteers created a fun and festive environment by hosting games and activities for children celebrating Halloween. Kids enjoyed exciting attractions such as bouncy castles, indoor throwing games, and basketball shooting challenges, with opportunities to win prizes that brought smiles and joy to all who participated. The festival provided a safe and memorable experience for families to come together and celebrate the season.

    <div class="positiontextcenterbody">On November 11th, 2024, members of Seguin Keyclub helped in the OS Gray's November monthly cleanup. Our members helped the local park clear the invasive species, such as privet, clearing the way for local species to begin growing
    back into the ecosystem. All our members had plenty of fun and we thank everyone who came out and gave their time to the community! We hope to see everyone again and more next time! </div
