# Key Club Website
The goal of this project is to create a working website designed for Juan Seguin High School’s Key Club. Key Club members and those interested will be able to expand their knowledge about the club and prepare themselves as volunteers and community members. The project has been directly approved by the sponsor Mrs. W.H, and all implementations are approved, but comments to look at other similar websites to find any left out features.
# Implementation
This project will contain key features such as a calendar, information about the club such as who they are and what they represent, officer information, which includes the sponsors, and affiliates such as the Kiwanis Club, web links to other useful sites and information, and a accomplishment tab to keep up with key club and what they want to show off. The website will be using HTML as its coding language because of its capabilities in website development.

The calendar will contain information such as future keyclub volunteering events, keyclub meetings, deadlines, and other volunteering opportunities. To implement a calendar, we would need to learn how to implement a code to grab data from data sheets, manual implementations, of events, and implement a way to display event details such as when, where, and about the job. This can happen using the Google Calendar API 
The next implementation is the information tab found by navigating through the hyperlinks in the website. The information tab will contain information that describes the identity of Key Club and what led to its creation. Additionally, there will be information about what Key Club represents, its motives, goals, and purpose. The way we can program this information is by creating tabs utilizing the button class and <div> to display the different divisions of the whole document. Furthermore we can display images related to Key Club by uploading the image files to the website’s folder and using the <img> tag to embed the images in the web page.

Using the same processes for coding the information tab will be the officer tab. The officer tab will contain the credentials for each of the six officers and their duties. Those officers being President, President Vice, Project Manager, Secretary, Historian, Webmaster. Each officer will have their own image coupled with their information.
The accomplishment tabs will work as a web page which will allow members to navigate to different past events such like a forum. Each forum page will contain events from major volunteering opportunities, to awards such as grants or recognition. Each forum will include the summary of the event, images to help convey what has been accomplished, and other minor details such as thanking third parties. 
The final implementation for the website will be the additional websites associated with Key Club such as the members’ volunteer hours, volunteering sign ups Google forms, Key Club member sign up, and past meeting Google slides. By employing the <a> element is the href attribute to directly link the destination of the hyperlink to the website.

Overall, this website will be beneficial to the many of the Key Club members and associates so they can have an easier, streamlined information center for all things Key Club.

#Designing the Solution

In this project, we will be using the Agile development methodology to systematically solve our problem. Sources that our website needs to be designed and function properly include
